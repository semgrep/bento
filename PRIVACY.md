# Bento Privacy Policy

Bento collects usage data to help us improve the product. This document describes:

* the principles that guide our data-collection decisions
* the breakdown of the data that are and are not collected
* how we use the data we collect to make Bento better

## Principles

These principles inform our decisions around data collection:

1. **Transparency**: Collect and use data in a way that is clearly explained to the user and benefits them
2. **User control**: Put users in control of their data at all times
3. **Limited data**: Collect what is needed, de-identify where possible, and delete when no longer necessary

## Collected Data

Bento collects data to help improve its underlying tools and user experience. Two types of data are collected:

### Usage Data

As the name suggests, usage data tell us what commands you ran, what options and flags you ran them with, as well as information that helps us debug any issues users may be facing, e.g.

* The name of the command you ran,
* Arguments or options,
* How long the command took to run,
* If the command ran in a CI environment,
* The version of Bento you're using, 
* What OS and shell you're running in, etc.

See Description of Fields for a full list.

While using Bento in Beta, we associate these data with your email address to facilitate our outreach efforts.

### Results Data

Results data contain information about the code check rules that fired when you ran Bento, and help us make our rules better. These include:

* The number of times rules fired across your repo,
* Rules you disabled,
* The number of results that were fixed or archived since the last run, and
* Hashes of the repository and commit for which Bento produced these results,

We consider this information more sensitive and do NOT associate it with user-identifiable information.

### Data NOT collected

We strive to balance our desire to collect data for improving Bento and its underlying tools with our users' need for privacy. 

The following items don't leave your computer and are not sent or shared with anyone.

* Source code
* Raw repository names, filenames, or commit hashes,
* User-identifiable data about Bento's findings in your code

### Examples

This is a sample blob of usage data collected by Bento and sent to r2c:
