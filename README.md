Bento is a free bug-finding tool that runs locally when you commit code. It has specialty checks for common Python 3 web frameworks and OSS checks for Python, Docker, and shell files.

- **Find bugs that matter.** Bento runs its [own checks](#bento-checks) and OSS tools to catch actual bugs. Checks are fine-tuned based on their behavior across thousands of PyPI projects, and Bento never reports style-related issues.
- **Keep your workflow.** Unlike other tools, you won’t have to fix existing bugs to adopt Bento. Other project contributors won’t see Bento files or have their workflows changed. It’s just for you.
- **Go delightfully fast.** Bento runs its tools in parallel, not sequentially, on the code you’ve changed. Its jobs run entirely locally when you commit your code.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip3 install bento-cli
```

Bento requires [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). It's tested on macOS 10.14+ and Ubuntu 18.04+.

## Motivations
> See our [Bento introductory blog post](https://bento.dev/blog/2019/our-quest-to-make-world-class-security-and-bugfinding-available-to-all-developers/) to learn the full story.

r2c is on a quest to make world-class security and bugfinding available to all developers, for free. We’ve learned that most developers have never heard of—let alone tried—tools that find deep flaws in code: like Codenomicon, which found [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/), or Zoncolan at Facebook, which finds more [top-severity security issues](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238344-scaling-static-analyses-at-facebook/fulltext) than any human effort. These tools find severe issues and also save tons of time, identifying [hundreds of thousands of issues](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43322.pdf) before humans can. Bento is a step towards universal access to tools like these.

We’re also big proponents of opinionated tools like Black and Prettier. This has two implications: Bento ignores style-related issues and the bikeshedding that comes with them, and it ships with a curated set of checks that we believe are high signal and bug-worthy. See [Three things your linter shouldn’t tell you](https://bento.dev/blog/2019/three-things-your-linter-shouldnt-tell-you/) for more details on our decision making process.

## Usage
### Getting Started
From the root directory of a project:

```bash
$ bento init
```

This configures Bento for you only. See [Team Use](#team-use) to setup Bento for all contributors.

### Upgrading
> Docker is a requirement for Bento 0.8+.

Run the following commands to upgrade Bento:

```bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade bento-cli
$ cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
$ rm -r ~/.bento .bento* && bento init
```

The last line removes all Bento artifacts as their formats have not yet stabalized between releases, including the Bento archive.

For Bento 0.8+ no Bento files need to be tracked with Git unless you’re using Bento in CI. See [Running in CI/CD](#running-in-ci/cd) for details.

### Command Line Options
```
$ bento --help

Usage: bento [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --help             Show this message and exit.
  --version              Show current version bento.
  --base-path DIRECTORY  Path to the directory containing the code, as well as
                         the .bento.yml file.
  --agree                Automatically agree to terms of service.
  --email TEXT           Email address to use while running this command
                         without global configs e.g. in CI

Commands:
  archive       Adds all current findings to the whitelist.
  check         Checks for new findings.
  disable       Turn OFF a tool or check.
  enable        Turn ON a tool or check.
  init          Autodetects and installs tools.
  install-hook  Installs Bento as a git pre-commit hook.

  To get help for a specific command, run `bento COMMAND --help`
```

### Exit Codes
`bento check` may exit with the following exit codes: 
- `0`: Bento ran successfully and found no errors
- `2`: Bento ran successfully and found issues in your code
- `3`: Bento or one of its underlying tools failed to run

## Workflows

### Individual Use
Bento configures itself for personal use by default. This means that it:

1. Automatically checks for issues introduced by your code, as you commit it
2. Only affects you; it won’t change anything for other project contributors or modify Git state

Initialization enables `autorun` behind the scenes, which can be can be enabled or disabled using:

```bash
$ bento [ enable|disable ] autorun
```

This feature makes use of Git hooks. If the Bento hook incorrectly blocks your commit, you can skip it by passing the `--no-verify` flag to Git at commit-time (please use this sparingly since all hooks will be skipped):

```bash
$ git commit --no-verify
```

### Team Use
#### Running Locally
To setup Bento for all project contributors, add Bento’s configuration to Git (it’s ignored by default):

```bash
$ cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
$ git add --force .bento .bentoignore
```

Contributors can run Bento for themselves using the project’s configuration via:

```bash
$ bento init
```

#### Running in CI/CD
Bento in CI analyzes your entire project, not just the latest commit. So that you don’t have to fix all existing issues before making Bento blocking, its `archive` feature allows historical issues to be tracked and ignored during CI.

To use the `archive` feature so Bento returns a non-zero exit code only for new issues, rather than all existing issues, first create the archive:

```bash
$ cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
$ bento archive --comparison root
```

Commit Bento’s configuration to the project:

```bash
$ git add --force .bento .bentoignore
```

You can then add Bento to your CI scripts:

```bash
$ pip3 install bento-cli && bento --version
$ bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check --comparison archive
```

If you use CircleCI, the above commands become:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
    bentoCheck:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7.4-stretch-node
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Install Bento"
          command: pip3 install bento-cli && bento --version
      - run:
          name: "Run Bento check"
          command: bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check --comparison archive
```

`bento check` will exit with a non-zero exit code if it finds issues in your code (see [Exit Codes](#exit-codes)).

If you need help setting up Bento with another CI provider please [open an issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/bento/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Documentation PRs welcome if you set up Bento with a CI provider that isn’t documented here!


## Bento Checks
Bento finds common security, correctness, and performance mistakes in projects containing Flask, Requests, and Boto 3. We’re inspired by tools that help ensure correct and safe framework use, like [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react). Learn more about Bento’s specialty checks at [checks.bento.dev](https://checks.bento.dev/).
