Bento is a free and opinionated toolkit for gradually adopting linters[¹](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) and program analysis[²](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis) in your codebase. Be the bug-squashing advocate your team needs but (maybe) doesn’t deserve.

- **Find bugs that matter.** Bento runs its [own checks](#bento-checks) and OSS tools to catch actual bugs. It never reports style-related issues and its checks are chosen based on performance across the PyPI and npm ecosystems.
- **Keep your workflow.** Unlike other tools you won’t have to fix existing bugs to adopt Bento. It takes 30 seconds to get started and coding again.
- **Go delightfully fast.** Bento runs its tools in parallel, not sequentially, on the code you’ve changed. Its jobs run entirely locally when you commit your code.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip3 install bento-cli
```

Bento is for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python 3 projects. It requires Python 3.6+ and works on macOS Mojave (10.14) and Ubuntu 18.04+.

## Motivations
> See our [Bento introductory blog post](https://medium.com/@ievans/our-quest-to-make-world-class-security-and-bugfinding-available-to-all-developers-for-free-dce9eb7b06d0) to learn the full story.

r2c is on a quest to make world-class security and bugfinding available to all developers, for free. We’ve learned that most developers have never heard of—let alone tried—tools that find deep flaws in code: like Codenomicon, which found [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/), or Zoncolan at Facebook, which finds more [top-severity security issues](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238344-scaling-static-analyses-at-facebook/fulltext) than any human effort. These tools find severe issues and also save tons of time, identifying [hundreds of thousands of issues](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43322.pdf) before humans can. Bento is a step towards universal access to tools like these.

We’re also big proponents of opinionated tools like Black and Prettier. This has two implications: Bento ignores style-related issues and the bikeshedding that comes with them, and it ships with a curated set of checks that we believe are high signal and bug-worthy. See [Three things your linter shouldn’t tell you](https://blog.r2c.dev/posts/three-things-your-linter-shouldnt-tell-you/) for more details on our decision making process.

## Bento Checks
Bento targets popular frameworks (Flask, Requests, Boto 3), rather than entire languages (Python, JavaScript). Our work is inspired by framework-specific tools like [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).

Learn more about our custom checks at [checks.bento.dev](https://checks.bento.dev/).

## Usage
### Getting Started
To get started right away with sensible defaults:

```bash
$ bento init && bento check
```

To set aside preexisting results so you only see issues in new code:

```bash
$ bento archive
```

Bento is at its best when run automatically. See [Integrations](#integrations) for details.

### Upgrading
Run the following commands to upgrade Bento:

```bash
$ pip3 install --upgrade bento-cli
$ cd <PROJECT DIRECTORY>
$ rm -r .bento* && bento init
$ git add .bento* && git commit -m "Upgrade Bento configs"
```

### Command Line Options
```
$ bento --help

Usage: bento [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --help             Show this message and exit.
  --version              Show current version bento.
  --base-path DIRECTORY  Path to the directory containing the code, as well as
                         the .bento.yml file.
  --agree                Automatically agree to terms of service.
  --email TEXT           Email address to use while running this command
                         without global configs e.g. in CI

Commands:
  archive       Adds all current findings to the whitelist.
  check         Checks for new findings.
  disable       Turn OFF a tool or check.
  enable        Turn ON a tool or check.
  init          Autodetects and installs tools.
  install-hook  Installs Bento as a git pre-commit hook.

  To get help for a specific command, run `bento COMMAND --help`
```

### Exit Codes
`bento check` may exit with the following exit codes: 
- `0`: Bento ran successfully and found no errors
- `2`: Bento ran successfully and found issues in your code
- `3`: Bento or one of its underlying tools failed to run

## Integrations

### Running Bento in CI
If you use CircleCI, add the following job:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
    bentoCheck:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7.4-stretch-node
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Install Bento"
          command: pip3 install bento-cli && bento --version
      - run:
          name: "Run Bento check"
          command: bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check
```

Otherwise, you can simply install and run Bento in CI with the following commands:

```bash
$ pip3 install bento-cli && bento --version
$ bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check
```

`bento check` will exit with a non-zero exit code if it finds issues in your code (see [Exit Codes](#exit-codes)). To suppress this behaviour you can pipe its output to `true`:

 ```bash
 $ bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check || true
 ```
 
Otherwise, address the issues or archive them with `bento archive`.

If you need help setting up Bento with another CI provider please [open an issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/bento/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Documentation PRs welcome if you set up Bento with a CI provider that isn't documented here!

### Running Bento as a Git Hook
Bento can automatically analyze your staged files when `git commit` is run. Configured as a Git pre-commit hook, Bento ensures every commit to your project is vetted and that no new issues have been introduced to the codebase.

To install Bento as a Git hook:

```bash
$ bento install-hook
```

If Git hooks ever incorrectly block your commit, you can skip them by passing the `--no-verify` flag at commit-time (use this sparingly):

```bash
$ git commit --no-verify
```

Bento’s Git hook can save the round-trip time involved with fixing a failed build if you’re using [Bento in CI](#running-bento-in-ci).
