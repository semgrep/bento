Bento is a free and opinionated toolkit for gradually adopting linters[¬π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) and program analysis[¬≤](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis) in your codebase. Be the bug-squashing advocate your team needs but (maybe) doesn‚Äôt deserve.

- **Find bugs that matter.** Bento automatically enables and configures relevant analysis based on your dependencies and frameworks, and it will never report style-related issues. You won‚Äôt painstakingly configure your tooling.
- **Get started immediately.** Bento doesn‚Äôt force you to fix all your preexisting issues today. Instead, you can archive them and address them incrementally when it makes sense for your project.
- **Go fast.** Bento installs in 5 seconds and self-configures in less than 30. Its tools check your code in parallel, not sequentially.

Bento includes checks written by [r2c](https://r2c.dev/) and curated from [Bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/), and their plugins. It runs on your local machine and never sends your code anywhere or to anyone.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip3 install bento-cli
```

Bento is for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python projects. It requires Python 3.6+ and works on macOS Mojave (10.14) and Ubuntu 18.04+.

## Usage
To get started right away with sensible defaults:

```bash
$ bento init && bento check
```

To set aside preexisting results so you only see issues in new code:

```bash
$ bento archive
```

Bento is at its best when run automatically as a git hook (i.e. `bento install-hook`) or as part of CI.

### Command Line Options
```bash
$ bento --help

Usage: bento [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version  Show current Bento version.
  --agree    Automatically agree to terms of service.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  archive       Adds all current findings to the whitelist.
  check         Checks for new findings.
  disable       Disables a check.
  enable        Enables a check.
  init          Autodetects and installs tools.
  install-hook  Installs Bento as a git pre-commit hook.
```

### Exit Codes
`bento check` may exit with the following exit codes: 
- `0`: Bento ran successfully and found no errors
- `2`: Bento ran successfully and found issues in your code
- `3`: Bento or one of its underlying tools failed to run

### Running Bento in CI
If you use CircleCI, add the following job:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
    bentoCheck:
    executor: circleci/python:3.7.4-stretch-node
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Install Bento"
          command: pip3 install bento-cli && bento --version
      - run:
          name: "Run Bento check"
          command: bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check
```

Otherwise, you can simply install and run Bento in CI with the following commands:

```bash
pip3 install bento-cli && bento --version
bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check
```

`bento check` will exit with a non-zero exit code if it finds issues in your code (see [Exit Codes](#exit-codes)). You can run `bento --agree --email <YOUR_EMAIL> check || true` if you'd like to prevent Bento from blocking your build. Otherwise, address the issues or unblock yourself by running `bento archive`.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/returntocorp/bento/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) if you need help setting up Bento with another CI provider. If you set up Bento with your provider of choice, we'd appreciate a PR to add instructions here!
